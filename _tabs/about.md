# About

Hi, I'm h4ck3rfirst, a passionate web security enthusiast and developer. I co-founded [your project or team, e.g., "RedTeam Hub"](https://github.com/yourproject) to explore ethical hacking and build secure apps.

With a background in [your experience, e.g., "computer science and cybersecurity"], I spend my days diving into vulnerabilities, coding tools in Python and JS, and sharing knowledge through blogs and open-source repos.

Interests: Red teaming, AI/ML for security, Jekyll sites, and coffee-fueled late-night debugging.
