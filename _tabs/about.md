# Nikhil Deepak Vishwakarma  
**Aspiring Offensive Security Professional**  
---

I am a passionate beginner in **offensive security** with strong hands-on experience in penetration testing, ethical hacking, and vulnerability research. I regularly solve labs and machines on **TryHackMe**, **HackTheBox**, and **PortSwigger Web Security Academy**. I love breaking things (legally) and learning how systems can be secured better.
